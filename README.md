iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the
general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.

### Features
1. Users can create an account and log in.
2. Users can create a red-flag record (An incident linked to corruption).

4. Users can edit their red-flag or intervention records.
5. Users can delete their red-flag or intervention records.
6. Users can add geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention records.
7. Users can change the geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) attached to their red-flag or intervention records.
8. Admin can change the status of a record to either under investigation, rejected (in the event of a false claim) or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and resolved).

### Hopeful features
1. Users can add images to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
2. Users can add videos to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
3. The application should display a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or intervention location.
4. The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the status of their record.
5. The user gets real-time sms notification when Admin changes the status of their record.
